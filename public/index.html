			I'm a Kenyan tinker of all things I deem interesting. Been programing on and off for about 6 years (2 years seriously). Was introduced to computers relatively late in life and have enjoyed them immensely since. Looking to deepen my understanding and therefore improve my use of tools available for ruby on the web.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Interests</h2>
		<p>Wide and varied, I'm mostly drawn to things that can be dismantled, eaten and enjoyed with others. A quick list would include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Travel:</b> exploring different cultures and sensations is always a welcome experience</li>
			<li><b>Food:</b> ties into the travel, the weirder the better. Top of the list, BACON</li>
			<li><b>Computers:</b> build, play games on, create things on...love em</li>
			<li><b>Books:</b> Some I read, some I just love the smell</li>
			<li><b>Farming:</b> gotta love the smell of freshly turned earth</li>
			<li><b>Comedy:</b> Strictly when performed by others, my jokes are awful, should never be said out loud.</li>
			<li><b>Cars:</b> VROOM, VROOM, Lancer Evolution 6.5 tops my list here</li>
			<li><b>Planes:</b> Still jump around every time I fly....human flight is sweet</li>
			<li>...</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Oh the places...</h2>
		<p>I can currently be found skipping around beautiful and historic Boston. Though I love to travel, I hate the actual traveling and teleportation, in my opinion, is long overdue. Between airport checks and traffic and intense planning that never seems to pan out....hair-pulling. All that aside, my current visit-wish-list includes: Hawaii, Punta Cana, Costa Rica, Machu Pichu, London, Grand Canyon, Miami, Munich, Pyramids of Giza, Addis Ababa, Sydney....</p>
		
		<p>It will take a while, but I hope it happens soon.</p>
		
		<h2>In Short...</h2>
		<p>I am a simple guy, easily distracted and entertained by the things around me. This will have to do for now as I'm chasing a different and totally awesome deadline.</p>
